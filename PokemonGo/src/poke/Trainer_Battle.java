//This class is similar to the Wild_Battle, but involves another trainer
//This opposing trainer has several pokemon, and the user must defeat all of them
//In Trainer battles, the user cannot capture opposing pokemon
//In practice, that means this class won't call the Pokeball class
//Instead, if "pokeball" is selected it just returns text of "You can't catch another trainer's pokemon!"
